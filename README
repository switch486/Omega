How to install a developing environment for the project?

1. Maven is used to manage and build the project and all subprojects. 
   Install maven if you haven't already.
2. Fetch an eclipse with a maven plugin. It will make the
   development easier. SpringSource Tool Suite is fine.
3. Clone git repository.
4. Perform 'mvn compile'.
5. Import the projects to eclipse.
6. Profit.

Before you commit.

1. Run 'maven clean' so the target directories are deleted.
