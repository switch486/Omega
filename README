What is this project about?

This is a proof of concept project designed to play a web browser based game. It uses the selenium as the web worker to manipulate with web pages and the session within. In the future, a specialised AI will make the gaming decisions.

-------------------------
How to install a developing environment for the project?

Installations:
maven, eclipse, git, gitstats, gnuplot, python
I would propose to install the STS (Spring Tool Suite) - eclipse + maven, and the rest via apt-get installation (debian/ubuntu)
All dependencies are being downloaded automatically with the 'mvn compile' command.

1. Maven is used to manage and build the project and all subprojects.    
2. Clone git repository.
3. Perform 'mvn clean compile'.
4. Import the projects to eclipse.
5. Profit.
